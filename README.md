# compression_pca

### PREFERRED ENVIRONMENT --> JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

This project would focus on mapping high dimensional data to a lower dimensional space, a necessary step for projects that utilize data compression or data visualizations. As the ethical discussions surrounding AI continue to grow, scientists and businesses alike are using visualizations of high dimensional data to explain results.
During this project, we will perform K Means clustering on the well known Iris data set, which contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. To visualize the clusters, we will use principle component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features in the dataset.
